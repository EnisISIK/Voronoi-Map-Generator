# 2D Voronoi-Map-Generator
A Basic Voronoi Diagram based Biome Generation Tool

This is a simple tool which is designed to create a 2D map using a Distorted Voronoi Diagram, assigning unique biomes to each seed based on temperature, humidity, and land values.


You can customize world generation by adding different biomes and adjusting temperature and humidity thresholds according to it.
